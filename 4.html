Vivekananda Society of Miranda House welcomes you all to its annual fest "YOUTHSAV"; May we learn and grow together. Here at Vivekananda Society we try  to understand the philosophy and ideals of Swami Vivekananda and try to inculcate the feeling of brotherhood and peace in our daily lives. Vivekananda believed a lot in the power of youth. He always preached to live with a never dying spirit. After all, Youth is the time to do something and be someone!
